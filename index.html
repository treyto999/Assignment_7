        Welcome to our photography articles page. Hopefully, in time we will add more and more useful articles including those submitted by you that are well written, informative and of course interesting to our readers. The purpose of good photography articles should be to provide useful and helpful information. Articles on a variety of photography subjects from:
        <br>
        <br>
        Digital or film photography<br>
        Wedding photography<br>
        Commercial photography<br>
        Macro photography<br>
        Still life photography<br>
        Portrait photography<br>
        Aerial photo and video<br>
        Videography<br>
        Digital imaging<br>
        ...and anything else you can think of.<br>
        <br>

Do you still use film? What are your reasons? Have you just gone digital and have something to say? Have you found that perfect accessory that we just have to have? Each of your photography articles should be at least 400 words long and the information should ideally come from personal experience.

They should include examples, brand names (if necessary), equipment, techniques, suggestions, hints, tips and interesting stories and experiences. <br> It is extremely important that the photography articles you submit to us are 100% original and exclusive to ATP.

We will check this before making your article live on our website as Google frowns upon duplicate content scattered over the web. You can add a link to your own personal web page if you wish, in order to back up any advice with example photographs and images.<br>

By submitting an article, you agree that all articles will be subject to review and minor alterations with regard to spelling and grammar if necessary. Please email all articles and images to us here.<br>
